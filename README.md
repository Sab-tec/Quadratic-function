# Quadratic-function

this program works by the user intering a quadratic equation
then the program find a and b and c
then it does the equations needed.

this program results contains:

1.the points that collide with the x-axis
and if the equation doesn`t collide with x-axis the program prints so.

2.the point that collide with the y-axis.

3.the program checks if this Quadratic-function has a max point or a min point
then the program print the max/min point.
